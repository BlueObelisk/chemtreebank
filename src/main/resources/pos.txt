Note that some versions of the tagged Brown corpus contain combined tags. For instance the word "wanna" is tagged VB+TO, since it is a contracted form of the two words, want/VB and to/TO. Also some tags might be negated, for instance "aren't" would be tagged "BER*", where * signifies the negation. Additionally, tags may have hyphenations: The tag -HL is hyphenated to the regular tags of words in headlines. The tag -TL is hyphenated to the regular tags of words in titles. The hyphenation -NC signifies an emphasized word. Sometimes the tag has a FW- prefix which means foreign word.
